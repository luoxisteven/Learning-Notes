## Learning Notes
- This repository contains some of the notes Iâ€™ve taken over the years.
- The original repository is located at [https://github.com/luoxisteven/Learning-Notes](https://github.com/luoxisteven/Learning-Notes).
- I take notes in an IDE like VS Code and then upload them to the GitHub repository above.
- In order to keep everything up to date, the newest version of the notes will be pulled from the link above at scheduled times every day and `continuously integrated and deployed (CI/CD)` into the backend of the website through `crontab` .
