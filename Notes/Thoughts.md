# Thoughts

- As we grow older, we develop better heuristics compared to when we were younger, thanks to the accumulation of experience. This enables us to better assess our current status in relation to our goals. However, the most important thing to remember is that no matter how refined our heuristics are or how much experience we have, heuristics remain approximations, and experience is just that—experience. There is no way to estimate the exact cost or reward with complete certainty. What’s even more challenging is that human life can often be modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). This is because rewards and costs are often probabilistic rather than deterministic. And as we know, solving a POMDP is far more complex than a standard Markov Decision Process (MDP), right? In conclusion, even when we make the right decision based on our heuristics, the outcome often boils down to luck. So, don’t be frustrated if the result doesn’t meet your expectations. Sometimes, it’s just a matter of luck.
-  I love the SECI knowledge management framework by Ikujiro Nonaka. In his theory, knowledge exists in two forms: 1) Implicit Knowledge, and 2) Explicit Knowledge. They are transformable. We may have a subconscious sense of doing what is right, but we need to articulate it through language.
The evolution of knowledge and wisdom comes not only from translating thoughts into language, but also from moving between subconscious and conscious understanding, and even from subconsciousness to subconsciousness.
- Implicit knowledge refers to the knowledge that cannot be expressed in words. Have you ever had the experience of drawing conclusions from your own insights, only to realize later that these conclusions were actually formed over a long period of time as events unfolded? The moment a conclusion is drawn is when implicit knowledge is transformed into explicit knowledge. Writing a diary can be beneficial to this process. Although I don’t have this habit, I have started writing conclusions to transform my implicit knowledge into explicit knowledge. The transformation of knowledge, whether from implicit to explicit, explicit to explicit, explicit to implicit, or implicit to implicit, represents the evolution and progress of our understanding.
- I love the word “justification” because it is one of the unique words in English. In the dictionary, “justification” is defined as “the action of showing something to be right or reasonable.” Why is it unique? Chinese, known as a logographic script, can express the same meaning with fewer characters compared to English, which is an alphabetic script. This gives Chinese a higher information density per character. For example, the Chinese character “山” means “mountain,” and its shape resembles a mountain, right? Similarly, “吃了吗?” translates to “Have you eaten yet?” in English, expressing the same meaning with fewer characters. While English generally has a higher information density compared to Chinese, the word “justification,” on the other hand, conveys a concept with greater density than what Chinese can easily express. I can only convey the meaning of "justification" using a long sentence, unlike English, which expresses it with just a single word.
- I love the word “justification” not only for its high information density but also because it serves as a reminder: “If you are wrong, don’t justify yourself.” We spend our whole lives justifying ourselves or trying to prove that we are right. If we are wrong, we shouldn’t justify it. Instead, we should accept it, move forward, and keep it in mind as a reminder for the future. However, there’s a contradiction here—if you keep it in mind too much, it might linger like a nightmare, haunting your thoughts and holding you back. The solution is to accept the fact that everyone can make mistakes, and you can only achieve a better version of yourself by trying new things and learning from those mistakes.
