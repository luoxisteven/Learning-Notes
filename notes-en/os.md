## Operating System (www.geeksforgeeks.org)
- Windows OS
- MacOS
- Linux
- Unix

### Characteristics of Operating Systems
- **Device Management:** The operating system keeps track of all the devices. So, it is also called the Input/Output controller that decides which process gets the device, when and for how much time.
- **File Management:** It allocates and de-allocates the resources and also decides who gets the resource.
- **Job Accounting:** It keeps track of time and resources used by various jobs or users.
- **Error-detecting Aids:** These contain methods that include the production of dumps, traces, error messages and other debugging and error-detecting methods.
- Memory Management: It is responsible for managing the primary memory of a computer, including what part of it are in use by whom also check how much amount free or used and allocate process
- Processor Management: It allocates the processor to a process and then de-allocates the processor when it is no longer required or the job is done.
- Control on System Performance: It records the delays between the request for a service and the system.
- Security: It prevents unauthorized access to programs and data using passwords or some kind of protection technique.
- Convenience: An OS makes a computer more convenient to use.
- Efficiency: An OS allows the computer system resources to be used efficiently.
- Ability to Evolve: An OS should be constructed in such a way as to permit the effective development, testing and introduction of new system functions at the same time without interfering with service.
- Throughput: An OS should be constructed so that It can give maximum throughput (Number of tasks per unit time).

### Purposes of an Operating System
- It controls the allocation and use of the computing System’s resources among the various user and tasks.
- It provides an interface between the computer hardware and the programmer that simplifies and makes it feasible for coding and debugging of application programs.
### Tasks of an Operating System
- Provides the facilities to create and modify programs and data files using an editor.
- Access to the compiler for translating the user program from high-level language to machine language.
- Provide a loader program to move the compiled program code to the computer’s memory for execution.
- Provide routines that handle the details of I/O programming.

### 32/64 bit computer

### Assembler (汇编器)
Assembler is a program for converting instructions written in low-level assembly code into relocatable machine code and generating along information for the loader. It is necessary to convert user-written programs into machinery code. This is called a translation of a high-level language to a low-level that is machinery language.
